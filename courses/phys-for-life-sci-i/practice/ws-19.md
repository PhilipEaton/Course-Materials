### Example 01
A block of mass $M = 10\ \text{kg}$ slides from rest down a frictionless ramp such that the center of the block drops a distance $h$. As the block basses from point B to point C, it enters a 2 m section of track that has friction ($\mu_k = 0.3$). After passing point C, the block compresses the spring an amount 0.5 m and comes to a momentary stop. 

Find $h$.

  alt="A block labeled 10 kilograms starts at point A at the top of a vertical curved track. The block moves downward through the curve to point B at the bottom. The vertical drop from A is labeled h. From point B, the track continues horizontally through a 2-meter rough section marked with a kinetic friction coefficient of 0.3, ending at point C. At point C, a block rests on the track and is attached to a horizontal spring fixed to a wall on the right. The spring constant is labeled 160 newtons per meter."

### Example 02
A block of mass $M = 10\ \text{kg}$ is released from rest with the spring compressed by an amount $\Delta s = 1\ \text{m}$. Assume the surface the block slides on is frictionless, besides a 2 m stretch between points B and C ($\mu_k = 0.3$). 

What is the speed of the block at point A is it is located a distance of 1.4 m below the initial position?

  alt="A curved track starts at point A on the left, rises upward to point B, and then continues horizontally to point C. The vertical rise from A to B is labeled 1.4 meters. The horizontal section between B and C is 2 meters long and marked as a rough surface with a kinetic friction coefficient of 0.2. At point C, a 10-kilogram block sits on the track and is attached to a horizontal spring fixed to a wall on the right. The spring constant is labeled 160 newtons per meter."
