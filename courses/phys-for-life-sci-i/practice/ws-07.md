### Example 01
Draw the velocity and acceleration for the penguin at each of the labels points:


<img
  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec07/HW07Q1.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="A continuous path showing a penguin’s motion across three regions. The penguin begins on a flat, snowy surface where it accelerates from rest, then transitions onto smooth, frictionless ice where it slides horizontally, and finally moves over an edge into a curved ice gully that slopes downward and then upward into a vertical ice cliff on the opposite side. Several labeled points are marked along the path to indicate where students should draw velocity and acceleration vectors."
