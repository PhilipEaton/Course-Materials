<div class="two-column">

<div class="column">


<strong>Angular Momentum:</strong>
$$ 
L_\text{com} = bmr^2 \omega
$$

$b$: constant number <br>
$m$: mass <br>
$r$: "radius" of object <br>
$\omega$: angular velocity


</div>

<div class="column">


<strong>Torque:</strong>
$$
\tau = F_{\perp,r} \, r
$$

$F_{\perp,r} $: component of force acting perpendicular to $r$<br>
$r $: distance from pivot to point of application of force


</div>

### Example 01
Find the forces exerted by each alien on the beam.

<div class="work-space-sm"></div>


### Example 02
A student sits on a rotating bar stool holding a bike wheel (it is a new fad apparently). The wheel is initially spinning CCW in the horizontal plane as viewed from above. She now turns the bike when over. 

What happens?

### Example 03
Our sun is currently over 4.5 billion years old. In another 6 billion-ish years it will run out of its primary fuel and start secondary nuclear reactions. As a result, the sun will expand to a size many times larger than its current size, enveloping Venus and Mercury, and scorching the surface of out planet. This stage of a star’s life cycle is called a Red Giant. The current solar day (the time it take the sun to spin in place once) is about 25 earth days. 

Will the solar day get longer or shorter for the red giant sun?
