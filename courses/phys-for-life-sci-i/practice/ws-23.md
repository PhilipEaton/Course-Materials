### Example 01
An astronaut is motionless in outer space. Upon command, the propulsion unit strapped to her back engine ejects some gas with a velocity of +32 m/s, and the astronaut recoils with a velocity of 0.30 m/s. After the gas is ejected, the mass of the astronaut is 160 kg.

What is the mass of the ejected gas?

### Example 04
The 2 kg box slides down the frictionless surface as shown below. How fast is the 2 kg box traveling just before it collides with the 4 kg box?

<div class="two-column">

<div class="column">

<img
  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec23/WS23Q4A.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="A 2 kilogram box set at 1.25 meters falls down a ramp and is about to collide with a stationary 4 kilogram box with an unknown velocity."

</div>

<div class="column">

<img
  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec23/WS23Q4B.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="After the collision the 2 kilogram box has an unknown velocity and the 4 kilogram box is traveling to the right with a speed of 2 m/s."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem 0; max-width:600px; width:80%;">
</div>

</div>

<div class="work-space-md"></div><br>

What is the velocity (magnitude and direction) of the 2 kg mass?

<div class="work-space-md"></div><br>

What kind of collision was this?

### Example 05
A 2 kg block is launched by a spring with 200 N/m that was compressed by 2 m. The small block passes point A after separating from the spring and enters a 30 m long rough patch where it experiences a 10 N friction force. After exiting the frictional patch, the small block passes through point B and slides down a frictionless incline, passing point C at the end. The small block then collides with a 15 kg block, coming to a complete stop after the collision. The large block passes point D after the collision and enters a rough patch where it experiences a 7.5 N friction force for 2 seconds, passing through point E as it exits the frictional
patch.

Determine the speeds of the blocks as they pass through each point.

  alt="A sketch of the problem. Point A is before the 30 m long rough patch and point B, these are at the top of the ramp. Point C is at the bottom of the ramp, just after it ends. Point D is position after the Large block and point E is after the final friction patch."
