### Example 01
A 1000 kg stunt car is moving at a speed of 20 m/s, The driver hits the brakes hard, and the car starts skidding (tires not turning). The
static and kinetic coefficients of friction between the road and the tires are 0.5 and 0.4 respectively.

What kind of friction force is acting on the tires, and what is the magnitude and direction of this friction force?

### Example 02
A 1000 kg stunt car is trying to move a 5000 kg truck. Even when applying its full force of 4,000 N, the truck will not budge. The
static and kinetic coefficients of friction between the road and the tires are 0.5 and 0.4 respectively.

What kind of friction force is acting on the tires, and what is the magnitude and direction of this friction force?

### Example 03
Alex stands on top of a speeding car (don’t ask why). If he has a weight of 700 N, and the coefficient of static friction between his shoes and the car is 0.3.

a) What is the maximum acceleration of the car such that he remains in place?  
b) Additionally, find his static frictional force if the car were accelerating at 2 m/s/s.  
c) Suppose the coefficient of kinetic friction between his shoes and the car is 0.2. What is Alex’s acceleration if the car is speeding up at 5 m/s/s?

### Example 04
You are trying to move the two boxes as shown in the picture below. The blue and green boxed have a mass of 10 kg and 5 kg, respectively. Presently, the blocks move with a constant acceleration of 2 m/s/s to the right. The static and kinetic coefficients of friction between the ground and the blue box are 0.3 and 0.2, and between
the blue box and green box are 0.6 and 0.4.

a) How big is the friction force on the blue box?  
b) How big is the friction force on the green box?  
c) How hard are you pushing the blue box?
