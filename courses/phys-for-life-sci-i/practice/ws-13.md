# Lecture 13 Worksheet

---

### Example 01
We have stolen a safe! You are using a dolly with frictionless wheels to move the safe filled with gold bullion while I deal with the coppers! The mass of the safe+gold is 875 kg and the mass of the dolly is 5 kg. The coefficient of static friction between the safe and dolly is large (1.1) so that the safe does not slip relative to the dolly. You push on the safe with enough force to speed it up at 0.4 m/s/s.

Find the friction force (flavor, magnitude, and direction) between the safe and the dolly.

### Example 02
What is the weight of a TV at the surface of the earth?

$$
F^g = G\fac{M_1 M_2}{r^2} = 
$$

### Example 03
What is the weight of a TV at 650 km above the surface of the earth?

$$
F^g = G\fac{M_1 M_2}{r^2} = 
$$

### Example 04
You are riding down in an elevator carrying a 30 kg backpack. When the elevator reaches its destination it slows down to a stop at a rate of 5 m/s/s. 

How heavy does the back pack feel?

### Example 05
You are riding down in an elevator carrying a 30 kg backpack. 

When the elevator first starts moving it speeds up at a rate of 5 m/s/s. How heavy does the back pack feel?
