Newton’s First Law:<br>

No Acceleration ↔ No Net (Total) Force<br>
<br>

Newton’s Second Law:<br>

Yes Acceleration ↔ Yes Net (Total) Force<br>
<br>

$$
F_\text{net} = m a

<div class="column">


Force due to gravity near Earth:

$$
F^g_{E,A} = m_A g = m_A (10 \text{N/kg})
$$

$F^g_{E,A}$: gravitational force of Earth on mass A<br>

$m_a$: mass of object A<br>

$g$$: Gravitational strength near Earth<br>

</div>

</div>

**Newton’s Third Law**: Forces result from two objects interacting with each other. As a result, all forces come in pairs.

These pairs must:
i) be the same flavor of force,
ii) act separately on each of the objects,
iii) be equal in magnitude, and
iv) be opposite in direction.

### Example 01
A block of mass m = 10 kg is being dragged to the right by a rope on a rough surface. The rope applies a tension force of 200 N. If the acceleration is 10 m/s/s, how big
is the friction force acting on the block? How big is the normal force from the floor acting on the block?

### Example 02
While walking on an icy road, you come across a cardboard box. Thinking it is creating a trip hazard, you decide to kick the box out of the way. Immediately after you kick the box, your friend estimates the box is sliding forward at 5 m/s while you slide backwards at 20 m/s. Suppose you weigh 700 N and your foot was in contact with the box for 0.2 s. 

Find the mass of the box *and* the force you exerted on the box.
