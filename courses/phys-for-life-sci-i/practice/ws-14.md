### Example 01
While in deep space with Alex, he and I play a game of catch. I throw a 200 kg boulder at a velocity of 100 m/s.

Is the boulder in equilibrium while it is sailing towards Alex after leaving my hands?

### Example 02
Alex is trying in vain to push a large freezer across his garage floor. The mass of the freezer, including contents, is 250 kg. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the freezer and the floor are 0.80 and 0.60, respectively. Alex is pushing with a horizontal force of 1000 N, but the freezer will not budge.

What is the magnitude of the frictional force acting on the freezer?

### Example 03
A supertanker of $1.70 × 10^8$ kg is moving with a constant velocity. Its engines generate a forward thrust of $7.40 × 10^5$ N.  

a) Find the magnitude of the total resistive force exerted on the tanker by the water and air.

b) Find the magnitude of upwards force exerted on the tanker by the water

### Example 04
A supertanker of $1.70 × 10^8$ kg is moving with a constant acceleration of 0.002 m/s/s. Its engines generate a forward thrust of $7.40 × 10^5$ N.  

a) Find the magnitude of the total resistive force exerted on the tanker by the water and air.

b) Find the magnitude of upwards force exerted on the tanker by the water

### Example 05
Books A and B have 2 kg and 6 kg of mass, respectively. If the hand pulls the string with a force of 80 N and the tabletop is frictionless, what will be the tension in string \#2?

A straight horizontal string connects the books, and the string continues to the right where a hand pulls it. Two downward arrows label sections of the string as String 2 (over the middle section) and String 1 (near the hand)."

### Example 06
Blocks A, B, and C have masses of 2 kg, 3 kg, and 5 kg, respectively. If these blocks are pushed to the right by a hand, with a force of 200 N. Assuming the tabletop is frictionless, determine the magnitude of all the forces that appear in each block’s free-body diagram.

A rightward-pointing arrow on the left shows a force of 200 newtons pushing on block A toward blocks B and C."
