### Example 01
How many radians are in a full circle (360 degrees)? A half circle (180 degrees)? A quarter circle (90 degrees)

### Example 02
A box is fastened to a string that is wrapped around a pulley. The pulley turns through an angle of 43 degrees. What distance, $d$, does the box move down?

### Example 03
The crank of a pulley is turned such that a 5 kg block is raised at a uniform rate of 0.4 m/s. How many revolutions per second does the crank have to be turned at to accomplish this? What is the direction of the angular velocity? Assume the radius of the pulley is 0.2 m.

  alt="A pulley of 0.2 meters in radius is being wound up. A rope, wound around the pulley, is connected to a hanging mass that moves up with an velocity as the pulley winds up."

### Example 04
The drill bit of a variable-speed electric drill has a constant angular acceleration of 2.5 rad/s/s. The initial angular speed of the bit is 5 rad/s. After 4 seconds find:

a) the new angular speed of the bit.   
b) the angle the bit has turned through.

### Example 05
A basketball player is balancing a spinning ball on the tip of their finger. The angular velocity of the ball slows down from 18.5 rad/s to 14.1 rad/s, during which the angular displacement if 81.5 rad. Determine the time this occurred over.

<div class="work-space-sm"></div>


### Example 06
Suppose a spindle of radius 1 m is rolling along the ground letting out string as it goes. The string does not drag or bunch up. If 10 m of string has been let out in 2 seconds, then how fast is the spindle moving and how fast it is turning?

<div class="work-space-sm"></div>


### Example 07
A toy drag car has front and rear tires of radii 0.1 m and 0.2 m, respectively. A child pushes the car such that is goes from rest to moving at 5 m/s by the time the front tires have rotated though and angle of 25 radians.

a) What are the angular velocities of the front and back tires when the car is moving at 5 m/s?  
b) What was the average angular acceleration of the front tires while the car was speeding up?  
c) What was the average translational acceleration of the car?  
d) Through what angle did the rear tires turn while the car was speeding up?  
e) How far did the car travel by the time it reaches the speed of 5 m/s?  
f) How many second did it take the car to reach the speed of 5 m/s?
