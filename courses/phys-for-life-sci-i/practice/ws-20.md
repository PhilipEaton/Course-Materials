### Example 01
You swing on a Tarzan rope beginning 5 m above the lake. Your 5 m rope is fastened to a tree limb that is 6 m above the surface of the lake. When you let go of the rope you have passed the bottom of your swing and have risen to a height of 2 m above the water.

How fast are you traveling just before you finally hit the water?

### Example 02
When a 15 kg bowling ball is launched by a spring compressed by 2 m, it slides past the top of the loop with a speed of 20 m/s.

a) What is the spring constant of the launching spring?  
b) What is the magnitude and direction of the normal force acting on the bowling ball when it is at the top of the loop?

  alt="A bowling ball moves along a large curved track shaped like part of a vertical circle. The cart is shown near at the top of the curve with a labeled speed of 20 meters per second. A dashed arrow from the center of the circle to the track indicates a radius of 8 meters. The track forms a circular path."

### Example 03
The Bobsled jump was a new event at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Park City, Utah (not really). The bobsled (+ occupants) are launched (at point A) by a large spring onto a huge semi-circular track ( 100 m) of frictionless ice. The bobsled teams try to achieve the furthest landing distance on a level landing field below.

a) Find the work done by the ramp on the bobsled as it moves from point A to point B.  
b) The mass of the bobsled+team is 800 kg. If they are traveling at a speed of 50 m/s when they reach point B, find the spring constant for the spring. Assume the spring was initially compressed by 4 m.  
c) How fast will the bobsled+team (800 kg) be going right before they hit the ground to the right?

  alt="A bobsled starts at point A on a flat section at the left side of a track. From point A, the track curves downward to a lowest point labeled B and then rises again on the right. The vertical drop from A to the dashed reference line is labeled 100 meters. The curved section of the track has a labeled radius of 100 meters. On the right side, the track rises to a height of 20 meters above the dashed reference line and then drops 20 meters below it before continuing horizontally."
