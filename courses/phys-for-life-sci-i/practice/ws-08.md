**Free fall**: No vertical obstrictions to motion, $a = - g = - 10\ \frac{\text{m/s}}{\text{m}}$ (Negative because it points down.)

### Example 01
During spring break you took a Caribbean cruise. While the ship was still docked, you kicked a soccer ball on the upper deck, which then fell off the deck with a speed of 25 m/s and landed in the ocean 75 m away. 

How high above the sea water is the deck of the ship?



<div class="work-space-md"></div>



### Example 02
A Safari Ranger is trying to tranquilize an unruly rhino. Using a helicopter, the ranger is situated above the ground and fires a tranquilizer at the rhino with a speed of 100 m/s at an angle of 37 below the horizontal. The bullet lands 2 second later.  
A) How high above the rhino was the helicopter when the bullet was fired?  
B) How far does the bullet travel in the horizontal direction before it lands?  
C) What was the speed of the bullet when it landed?

### Example 03
A diver springs upwards from a board that is 3 meters above the water. At the instant she contacts the water her speed is 9 m/s at an angle of 75 below the horizontal
surface of the water. 

Determine her initial velocity (magnitude and direction).

### Example 04
Alex is stranded on the wrong side of a canyon with a grizzly bear. In a desperate attempt to escape from the bear, Alex jumps to the other side of the canyon. He leaves the bear side of the canyon with a speed of 10 m/s at an angle of 53 above the horizontal. 

The canyon is 18 m wide and the other side is lower by 12 m. Does Alex make it to the other side?
