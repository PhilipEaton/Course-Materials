# Lecture 16 Worksheet

### Example 01
Initially the small block is held in place, so neight block can move. Compare the tension forces exerted by the string on the blocks to their weights.

  alt="A single pulley is attached to a ceiling. A rope passes over the pulley with two blocks hanging from its ends. The block on the left is labeled 3 kilograms, and the block on the right is labeled 5 kilograms. Both blocks hang vertically beneath the pulley."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem 0; max-width:600px; width:30%;">


<div class="work-space-lg"></div>

### Example 02
Now, the smaller block is released and the blocks are free to move. Compare the tension forces exerted by the string on the blocks to their weights.

  alt="A single pulley is attached to a ceiling. A rope passes over the pulley with two blocks hanging from its ends. The block on the left is labeled 3 kilograms, and the block on the right is labeled 5 kilograms. Both blocks hang vertically beneath the pulley."

### Example 03
A horizontal beam supports two pulleys, one on the left and one on the right. A rope runs over both pulleys. On the left side, a block labeled 20 kilograms hangs from the rope. On the right side, a block labeled 5 kilograms hangs from the rope. A third block labeled 5 kilograms rests on the rope between the two pulleys at the top.

What is the acceleration of each block is the surface is frictionless?

### Example 04
A frictionless inclined plane is set at an angle of 37 degrees above the horizontal. A 8-kilogram block rests on the inclined surface and is connected by a rope to a pulley at the top of the incline. On the other side of the pulley, a 2-kilogram block hangs vertically. 

When the masses are released from rest, will the 8 kg block…

a) move up the ramp  
b) stay put  
c) move down the ramp
