Newton’s First and Second Law:

$$
F_\text{net} = m a
$$

Force due to kinetic friction:

$$
f^k_{A,B} = \mu_k N_{A,B}
$$

$f^k_{A,B}$: kinetic friction A on B<br>
$\mu_k$: coefficient of kinetic friction<br>
$N_{A,B}$: Normal Force A pushing on B

**Free fall**: No vertical obstrictions to motion, $a = - g = - 10\ \frac{\text{m/s}}{\text{m}}$ (Negative because it points down.)

### Example 01
You are told the box below moves with a constant velocity. How is that
possible? (See slides for image)



<div class="work-space-md"></div>



### Example 02
Suppose a stone is sitting atop a crate. The crate is being pushed on and slides at a constant speed aross the floow. Does the stone experience any kinetic friction force as it moves without sliding on top of the crate? Explain.



<div class="page-break"></div>



### Example 03
A skier has a mass of 60 kg is sking down a hill set at an angle of 37 degrees above the horizontal. Coefficient of kinetic friction for snow is 0.25. 

What is her acceleration?
