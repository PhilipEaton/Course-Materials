<div class="column">

Newton’s First Law:<br>

No Acceleration ↔ No Net (Total) Force<br>
<br>

Newton’s Second Law:<br>

Yes Acceleration ↔ Yes Net (Total) Force

$$
F_\text{net} = m a
$$
</div>

<div class="column">


Force due to gravity near Earth:

$$
F^g_{E,A} = m_A g = m_A (10 \text{N/kg})
$$

$F^g_{E,A}$: gravitational force of Earth on mass A<br>

$m_a$: mass of object A<br>

$g$$: Gravitational strength near Earth<br>

### Example 01
Suppose Alex jumps off of a desk while in a vacuum. 

What will his acceleration be while he falls? (Use Newton’s second law)

### Example 02
I am redecorating my apartment. To do that I have to move my couch out of the room. The couch is 80 kg. I apply a lift and a push with a force of 500 N in total directed 37 degrees above the horizontal. The friction force of the carpet on the couch is 200 N. 

Determine the normal force by the floor on the couch *and* the acceleration of the couch.
