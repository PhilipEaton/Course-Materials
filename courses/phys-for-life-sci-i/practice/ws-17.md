### Example 01
A daredevil driving a motorcycle (combined mass of 500 kg) at its maximum speed of 20 m/s goes over a ramp set at a 37 degrees inclination with a height of 5 m. 

How fast will the daredevil be going then they hit the ground?

### Example 02
A gymnast performs a trick on the high bar. He pauses at the top of his swing for a moment, then swings down and dismounts. If we treat the gymnast as if all of his mass were concentrated right at his belly-button (which is always 0.9 m from the bar), how fast will he be traveling at the lowest point in his swing?
