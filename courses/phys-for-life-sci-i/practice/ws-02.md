To find the components of a hypotenuse (the sides of the triangle):

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opp}}{\text{Hyp}}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adj}}{\text{Hyp}}
$$

To find magnitude (hypotenuse) and direction (angle):

$$
(\text{Hyp})^2 = (\text{Adj})^2 + (\text{Opp})^2
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opp}}{\text{Adj}}
$$

  alt="The image shows a right triangle with the right angle at the lower right corner. The bottom side of the triangle is labeled “Adjacent,” and the vertical side on the right is labeled “Opposite.” The slanted side connecting the bottom left corner to the top right corner is labeled “Hypotenuse.” At the bottom left corner, the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side is marked with the Greek letter theta."

where $\theta$ (“theta”) an unknown angle.



**Displacement:** Straight-line distance *and direction* from the starting position to the final position.

### Example 01
In this problem, an ultimate Frisbee player runs a pattern made up of three displacement vectors, $\vec{A}$, $\vec{B}$, and $\vec{C}$. We want the **resultant displacement**, meaning the single displacement vector $\vec{R}$ that takes the player from the starting point directly to the ending point.

The given information is:

- $\vec{A} = 10\ \text{m}$ (straight up)
- $\vec{B} = 30\ \text{m}$ (to the right)
- $\vec{C} = 34\ \text{m}$ at an angle of $37^\circ$ below the positive $x$ direction  
  (so it points down and to the right)

  alt="The diagram shows three displacement vectors arranged head-to-tail. Vector A is a vertical arrow pointing upward with a magnitude of 10 meters. From the tip of vector A, vector B is drawn horizontally to the right with a magnitude of 30 meters. From the tip of vector B, vector C is drawn down and to the right at an angle of 37 degrees below the horizontal, with a magnitude of 34 meters. A dashed arrow labeled R runs from the starting point of vector A to the ending point of vector C, representing the resultant displacement for the entire motion."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; max-width:800px; width:60%;">

We want:
1. The magnitude of $\vec{R}$
2. The direction of $\vec{R}$ using turn-of-reference language

### Example 02
Suppose you walk 40 meters East and then 30 meters West. What is your displacement (magnitude and direction)?



<div class="work-space-md"></div>




### Example 03
Suppose you walk 40 meters East and then 30 meters North. What is your displacement (magnitude and direction)?



<div class="work-space-md"></div>


### Example 04
Suppose Morgan walks with a constant \textit{speed} of 0.3 m/s. Morgan must be traveling with a \textbf{uniform velocity}.

Is this statement Right, Wrong, or Sick and Wrong

Explain in your own words:

<div class="work-space-md"></div>

### Example 05
Suppose you have a hare that runs with a variable velocity and a tortoise which moves with a uniform velocity. With what velocity would the tortoise need to plod along to finish the race at the same tie as the hare?

<div class="work-space-md"></div>

If the hare traveled with a uniform velocity of 10 miles/hour for the first hour and then 4 miles/hour for the last two hours, what is the hare’s average velocity? What is the tortoise’s uniform velocity?
