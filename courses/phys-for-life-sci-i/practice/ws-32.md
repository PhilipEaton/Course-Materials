<strong>Convert Temperature Scales:</strong><br>
<br>

$ T(^\circ F) = \Big(\frac{9}{5}\Big) \, T(^\circ C) + 32 $
$ T(^\circ C) = \frac{5}{9} \Big(T(^\circ F) - 32 \Big) $
$ T(K) = T(^\circ C) + 273 $
$ \Delta T(K) = \Delta T(^\circ C) $


$b$: constant number <br>
$m$: mass <br>
$r$: "radius" of object <br>
$\omega$: angular velocity

<strong>Thermal Expansion</strong>
$$
\Delta L = \alpha \, L_i \, \Delta T
$$

$\Delta L$: change in length<br>
$\alpha$: coefficient of linear thermal expansion <br>
$L_i$: initial length <br>
$\Delta T$: change in tmperature

### Example 01
Using arrows, indicate the direction heat will be transferred between the two systems in the situations below.

  alt="Sketch of the described situation"
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem 0; max-width:600px; width:90%;"> 


### Example 02
In your own words, what is heat in the context of physics?

<div class="work-space-tiny"></div><br>


### Example 03
A mis-engineered moveable metal bridge has two sides that are each 20 m long. These pieces were placed flush to each other at a temperature of $0^\circ\text{C}$ and, unfortunately, bow up 10 degrees when the temperature goes up to $35^\circ\text{C}$. 

What is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material the bridge is made of?

### Example 04
Your European friend tells you that his body temperature is $42^\circ\text{C}$. Should you take him to the emergency room?

### Example 05
A 5 kg block of ice at $0^\circ\text{C}$ is placed inside an insulated vacuum container. Then, boiling water is poured in over top.

a) How much boiling water must be poured into the container to completely melt the ice?  
b) How much boiling water must be poured into the container so that the final temperature inside the container is $20^\circ\text{C}$?
