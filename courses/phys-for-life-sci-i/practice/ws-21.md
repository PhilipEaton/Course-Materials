<div class="two-column">

<div class="column">


<strong>Momentum:</strong> $ p = m v$<br>
<br>

$m$: mass<br>
$v$: velocity


</div>

<div class="column">


<strong>Impulse:</strong> $ \Delta p = F_\text{avg} \, \Delta t$<br>
<br>

$F_\text{avg}$: average force (vector!)<br>
$\Delta t$: change in time


</div>

### Example 01
Which one is harder to stop? 
- A mom and child on a tandem bike traveling at 2 m/s, or 
- A fully loaded supertanker traveling at 2 m/s

### Example 02
Which one is harder to stop? 
- A mom and child on a tandem bike traveling at 2 m/s, or 
- A mom and child on a tandem bike traveling at 16 m/s



### Example 03
Consider the following problems:

A) A fish of mass 0.5 kg is swimming to the right with a velocity of 1.2 m/s in a straight line.

Calculate the linear momentum of the fish.

<div class="work-space-tiny"></div><br>

B) A person with a mass of 70 kilograms is running at a velocity of 3 meters per second.

Calculate the linear momentum of the person.

<div class="work-space-tiny"></div><br>




### Example 04
Who has the bigger headache (i.e., whose head applied the greater force onto the flower pot): Alex, Philip, or Same?

  alt="The flower pot falling on Alex's head hits him taveling at 20 m/s and rebounds upwards at 20 m/s."

</div>

<div class="column">

  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec21/WS21Q4B.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="The flower pot falling on Philip's head hits him taveling at 20 m/s and sticks, not rebounding."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem 0; max-width:600px; width:80%;">

### Example 05
A tennis player hits an incoming tennis ball. Immediately before making contact with the racket, the speed of the ball is estimated to be 20 m/s. After hitting the racket, the ball is estimated to have a velocity of 25 m/s in the opposite direction it came in. If the ball is in contact with the racket for 0.25 seconds, determine the following:

A) The average acceleration and average net force for the ball.

<div class="work-space-tiny"></div>

B) The change in momentum (the impulse) and the average force for the ball.

<div class="work-space-tiny"></div>



### Example 06
Two identical cars are diving towards an intersection, one of them moving twice as fast as the other. When the two cars are side-by-side both drivers realize that the traffic light turned red and slam on the brakes. Which of the following is the correct comparison for their stopping **times**?  
A) They stop at the same time.  
B) The slower car takes twice as long to stop.  
C) The slower car takes four times as long to stop.  
D) The faster car takes twice times as long to stop.  
E) The faster car takes four times as long to stop.  



### Example 07
Two identical cars are diving towards an intersection, one of them moving twice as fast as the other. When the two cars are side-by-side both drivers realize that the traffic light turned red and slam on the brakes. Which of the following is the correct comparison for their stopping **distances**?  
A) They stop at the same distance.  
B) The slower car takes twice the distance to stop.  
C) The slower car takes four times the distance to stop.  
D) The faster car takes twice times the distance to stop.  
E) The faster car takes four times the distance to stop.
