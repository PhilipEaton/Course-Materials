<div class="two-column">

<div class="column">


<strong>Volume</strong>: An object fully submerged in a fluid will displace a volume of fluid equal to its own volume.<br>


<strong>Density</strong>: $ \rho = \fac{m}{V}$  <br>
<strong>Pressure</strong>: $ P = \fac{F}{A}$ <br>
<br>

$m$: mass <br>
$V$: volume <br>
$F$: force <br>
$A$: area 


</div>

<div class="column">


<strong>Pressure at Depth:</strong>
$$
P_2 = P_1 + \rho_\text{fluid} \, g \, h
$$

$P_2$: pressure at depth <br>
$P_1$: pressure at surface <br>
$\rho_\text{fluid}$: density of fluid <br>
$g$: gravitational strength <br>
$h$: depth

<div class="work-space-tiny"></div><br>


### Example 02
Answer the following qustions:

> Which has the larger density? A cup of water ; A lake of water ; Same density

> Which has the larger density? A kg of lead ; A kg of feathers ; Same density


### Example 03
Answer the following qustions:

> Where do you feel greater pressure on your ears at a depth of 10 m?  
> Lake Superior (143,000 sqr-mi) ; Lake Michigan (22,000 sqr-mi) ; Same pressure

> Where do you feel greater pressure on your ears at a depth of 10 m?  
> Lake Superior (143,000 sqr-mi) ; Atlantic Ocean (41 million sqr-mi) ; Same pressure



### Example 04
What is $h$ for $P_2 = 2 P_\tet{atm}$ in fresh water? ($P_\text{atm}$ = 101,325\  \text{N/m}^2$ and $\rho_\text{water} = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$)
