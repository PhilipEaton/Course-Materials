<div class="two-column">

<div class="column">

<strong>Acceleration</strong>

$$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$

$a$: acceleration <br>

$\Delta v$: Change in velocity <br>

$\Delta t$: Change in time <br>

</div>

<div class="column">

<strong>Velocity</strong>

$$
v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

$v$: velocity <br>

$\Delta x$: Change in position (the displacement) <br>

$\Delta t$: Change in time <br>

### Example 01
How do you move your pencil to create the following graphs? That is, what is the velocity versus time plot for the given position versus time plot?

  alt="A position versus time plot with a horizontal line. And a velocity versus time plot where you are meant to draw in your answer."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; max-width:800px; width:80%;">

<img
  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec03/WS03Q1B.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="A position versus time plot with a straight line going up and to the right. And a velocity versus time plot where you are meant to draw in your answer."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; max-width:800px; width:80%;">

<img
  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec03/WS03Q1C.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="A position versus time plot with a curved line ging up and to the right, getting steeper as it goes. And a velocity versus time plot where you are meant to draw in your answer."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; max-width:800px; width:80%;">


<div class="page-break"></div>





### Example 02
How would you interpret the motion for the following velocity versus time
plot?

<img
  src="{{ '/courses/phys-for-life-sci-i/images/lec03/WS03Q2.png' | relative_url }}"
  alt="A velocity versus time plot with a line beginning at a positive value, creaseing linearly, passing trough 0, and contimuing to a nagative value."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem 0; max-width:800px; width:80%;">


### Example 03
A track (not drawn to scale) is constructed as shown below. A ball rolls over the track, crossing the beginnings and ends of each segment at the times shown. The magnitudes of the ball’s velocity is observed to be 15 m/s at $t=0$ seconds and 5 m/s at $t=5$ seconds.

A) Determine the acceleration of the ball while it is traveling along the upward inclined
segment.

B) Determine the length of the level segment of the track.

C) Determine the velocity of the ball at $t=12$ seconds.

  alt="A track made in three segments. The first segment ramps up and to the right, the second is flat, and the third ramps down and to the right. The time at the beginning of the first ramp is 0 seconds, and at the end is 5 seconds. The time at the end of the second segment is 9 seconds, and at the end of the third segment is 12 seconds."
