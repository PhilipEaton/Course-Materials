# Lecture 15 Worksheet

---

### Example 01
You swing a bucket of water (1 kg) in a vertical circle at a constant speed of 5 m/s. What is the normal force by the bottom of the bucket acting on the water at:

a) the top of the circle;

b) the bottom of the circle.

### Example 02
Suppose the cylinder below is the beginnings of a carnival ride. The objective is to spin the cylinder, have the riders get pushed up against the walls, then drop out the ground and have all the riders stay stuck to the walls. During a test run, neither of the boxes slip when the cylinder of radius 2 m spins the boxes with at a speed of 4 m/s.

What is the minimum value for the coefficient of static friction between the wall and the 10 kg box?

The blocks are vertically aligned, with the 5-kilogram block resting on top of the 10-kilogram block and it not touching the wall. The 10-kilogram block is touching the wall."
