$a$: acceleration <br>

$\Delta v$: Change in velocity <br>

$\Delta t$: Change in time <br>

### Example 01
On Wednesday morning, while driving to class, you are traveling North at 20 mph and realize you are late for class! You hit the gas pedal hard and speed up to 56 mph in 2 seconds. 

What was your acceleration during the 2 second period?



<div class="work-space-sm"></div>



### Example 02
A car is moving 50 mph east. Ten second later it is moving at 70 mph east.

Find the car’s acceleration (magnitude and direction).

<div class="work-space-sm"></div>



### Example 03
A jogger is running east with 3 m/s. She speeds up at the rate of 2 m/s for 2 seconds. 

What is her final velocity?


<div class="page-break"></div>


### Example 04
Answer the following questions using the position versus time plot below:

A) At $t=16$ s, is car H speeding up, slowing down, or moving with a constant speed?

B) Is the acceleration of car H positive, negative, or zero at $t=16$ s?

C) Is the acceleration of car H positive, negative, or zero at $t=4$ s?

D) Which car is passing the other at $t=12$ s?

E) During the time interval shown, is the average velocity of car H greater than, less than, or equal to the average velocity of car T?
