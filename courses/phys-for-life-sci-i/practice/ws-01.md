### Today’s Toolkit

To find the **components** of a hypotenuse (the sides of the triangle):

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opp}}{\text{Hyp}}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adj}}{\text{Hyp}}
$$

To find **magnitude** (hypotenuse) and **direction** (angle):

$$
(\text{Hyp})^2 = (\text{Adj})^2 + (\text{Opp})^2
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opp}}{\text{Adj}}
$$

  alt="The image shows a right triangle with the right angle at the lower right corner. The bottom side of the triangle is labeled “Adjacent,” and the vertical side on the right is labeled “Opposite.” The slanted side connecting the bottom left corner to the top right corner is labeled “Hypotenuse.” At the bottom left corner, the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side is marked with the Greek letter theta."

where $\theta$ (“theta”) an unknown angle.



**Displacement:** Straight-line distance *and direction* from the starting position to the final position.

### Example 01
Suppose we have the triangle from above with the following measurements: $\theta = 37^\circ$ and a hypotenuse of 65. Find the opposite and adjacent side lengths.

<div class="work-space-md"></div>


 
### Example 02
Suppose we have the triangle from above with the following measurements: Opposite = 3 and Adjacent = 4. Find the hypotenuse (magnitude) and the direction. Find the magnitude (hypotenuse) and direction (angle)



<div class="work-space-md"></div>


### Example 03
Suppose a person walks:
- $5$ meters to the right
- then $3$ meters to the left

Find the total displacement (magnitude and direction) for this walk.



<div class="work-space-md"></div>


### Example 04
Now let’s look at a slightly more interesting case where the two vectors point in **different directions**.

Suppose a person walks:
- $4$ meters to the East
- then $3$ meters to the North

Find the total displacement (magnitude and direction) for this walk.
