## PHYS 2110 Homework 10 - Newton’s 3rd Law

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
Two blocks are placed on a frictionless table such that block A is in front of block B. A hand pushes on block A such that both blocks speed up while moving rightwards. Block A has a mass of 0.3 kg and block B has a mass of 0.5 kg.

  alt="A diagram showing two rectangular blocks, labeled A and B, in contact on a horizontal surface. Block A is positioned to the left of, touching, block B, and a hand is shown pushing on the left side of block A toward the right. Both blocks are labeled with an acceleration arrow pointing to the right, indicating they move together across a frictionless table. The figure visually supports a question about the forces and accelerations involved between the hand, block A, and block B."

a) How do the accelerations of block A, block B, and the hand compare to one another?

> Hint: Do the blocks/hand phase into one another or separate from one another? What does this means about their acceleration?

b) Draw and label separate free-body diagrams for blocks A and B. Think about the following:

- Do the blocks have mass? (Force due to gravity)
- What is each block touching? (Normal forces)
- Are there and ropes/strings/chains pulling one either block? (Tension)
- Is there friction between the blocks and the table? (Friction force)

c) Without doing any calculations, compare the magnitudes of the net force on each block. Explain how you arrived at this comparison.

> Hint: Remember, 𝐹net=𝑚⋅𝑎. You know how the masses compare, but how do the accelerations of each block compare? (see your answer to part a).

d) Calculate the magnitudes of all the forces in your diagrams for the case where the acceleration of block A is 4 m/s2.

e) How does the magnitude of the normal force the hand exerts on block A (𝑁Hand,𝐴) compare to the normal force block A exerts on Block B (𝑁𝐴,𝐵) ? Explain why this makes sense.

> Hint: Block A is accelerating to the right. What does this mean about the direction of the net force on block A? What does this mean for the two normal forces you are asked to compare?

### Question 2: 
A mother (50 kg) and child (25 kg) are facing each other in the middle of a frictionless pond of ice. The mother pushed horizontally on the child with a force of 100 N

a) What is the magnitude of the child’s acceleration?

b) What is the magnitude of the mother’s acceleration?
