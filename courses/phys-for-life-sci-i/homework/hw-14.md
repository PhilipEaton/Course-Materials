## PHYS 2110 Homework 14 -Equilibrium

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A block slides down an inclined ramp in the rightward direction, speeding up as it goes. The ramp is not frictionless (coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.50). The ramp makes and angle of 53-degrees with respect to the horizontal.

a) Draw a free-body diagram for the block. Be sure to properly label you forces!

b) If the magnitude of the normal force between the ramp and the block is 90 N, find the mass of the block.

c) Find the acceleration (magnitude and direction) of the block.

### Question 2: 
Two strings are pulling on a 50 kg block, as shown. The block does not move. The coefficient of static friction between the floor and the block is 0.6.

  alt="A 50 kg block rests on a horizontal floor with two strings attached, one pulling upward and to the right and the other upward and to the left. The left string has a tension of 200 N and an angle of 53° above the horizontal, while the right string has a tension of 100 N and an angle of 37°. The block remains stationary."

a) Find the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the floor on the block.

b) Find the magnitude of the frictional force by the floor on the block.
