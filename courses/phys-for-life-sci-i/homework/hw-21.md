## PHYS 2110 Homework 21 - Momentum and Impulse

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A softball of mass 0.2 kg is thrown horizontally directly toward a brick wall. It is traveling at 15 m/s just before hitting the wall and rebounds from the wall at 10 m/s, still traveling horizontally. The ball is in contact with the wall for 0.02 s and the ball is compressed a maximum of 0.007 m.

a) What is the magnitude of the ball's change in momentum from just before to just after striking the wall?   
b) What is the magnitude of the average force of the wall on the ball?

### Question 2: 
Object A is more massive than object B, but they have the same momentum. You stop each of them with the same resistive force. Answer and explain the following:

a)  Which one will stop in the shorter time, or will the times be the same?  
b) Which one will stop in the shorter distance, or will the distances be the same?
