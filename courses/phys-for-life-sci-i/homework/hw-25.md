## PHYS 2110 Homework 25 - Angular Velocity/Acceleration

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
The wheel of a stationary exercise bike is initially not rotating. It is then subjected to a constant angular acceleration of 2.5 rad/s$^2$ as it turns through 20 full revolutions. The radius of the wheel is 50 cm. 

a) How long did the acceleration last?  
b) What is the final angular speed of the wheel?  
c) How fast would the bike be moving it is were a real bike? Assume that the wheels are rolling without slipping.

### Question 2: 
A truck accelerates uniformly from rest and after 5 seconds the 75 cm radius wheels on the truck have an angular velocity $\omega_f = 30$ rad/s. 

a) What is the magnitude of the angular acceleration of the wheels?  
b) What is the magnitude of the final linear velocity of the truck?  
c) Through what total angle does each wheel turn in this time?
