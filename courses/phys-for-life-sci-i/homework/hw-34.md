## PHYS 2110 Homework 34 - Thermodynamics

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
The container with the movable massless piston and block of mass shown in the diagram to the right contains 2 moles of a diatomic gas. The gas is heated such that its temperature increases by 100 K while its pressure remains constant at $2 \times 10^5$  N/m$^2$. The piston rises 0.1 m in the heating process.

a) What is the change in the internal energy of the gas?   
b)  What is the magnitude of the work done by the gas?  
c)  What is the change in volume of the container?  
d)  What is the mass of the block?  
e)  What is the total amount of heat added to the gas during the heating process?

### Question 2: 
 A Carnot engine operates at 80\% efficiency. The waste heat is expelled to a cold reservoir at 300 K. If the engine does 6000 J of work,

a) Calculate the amount of heat that was absorbed from the high temperature reservoir.   
b) Determine the amount of heat expelled to the low temperature reservoir.  
c) Determine the temperature of the hot reservoir.  
d) If the temperature of the cold reservoir is increased to 500 K while the hot reservoir maintains its temperature, will the efficiency of the engine increase, decrease or stay the same?
