## PHYS 2110 Homework 04 - Acceleration

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
The positions of objects A and B are graphed to the right. Answer the following questions and explain. 
	
a) At $t = 16\,\text{s}$, is object B speeding up, slowing down, or moving with constant speed?

b) Is the acceleration of object B positive, negative, or zero at $t = 16\,\text{s}$? 

c) Is the acceleration of object A positive, negative, or zero at $t = 4\,\text{s}$? 

d) Which car is passing the other at $t = 12 \,\text{s}$?

e) For the full time interval shown, is the average speed of object B greater than, less than, or equal to the speed of object A?

Object A’s line is straight beginning at 0 seconds at positive 150m meters and ends at 20 seconds at negative 150 meters. Object B’s line changes slope over time, but begins and ends at the same times and places as A's plot. "

### Question 2: 
Consider the following figure of a ball pictured at various times while rolling some ramps. The time of each instance is shown above the ball. Assume the second segment of the ramp is made from a 4 meters long wooden cutout. Further, assume the ball started from rest at $t = 0\,\text{s}$.

  alt="A schematic drawing of a ball rolling along a track with three segments: a downward ramp a flat middle section an upward ramp and a second flat section. The two sloped segments are each labeled with an angle theta however the first ramp is angled downwards and the second ramp is angled upwards. The middle segment is flat and labeled as 4 meters long. The ball is shown at five different times: t equals 0.0 s at the top of the first ramp t equals 2.0 s at the bottom of the first ramp t equals 2.5 s at the end of the flat segment t equals 3.0 s near the top of the second ramp and t equals 4.0 s at the end of the second flat section."

a) Find the velocity of the ball at $t = 2.0\,\text{s}$.  

b) Find the acceleration of the ball while it is on the first segment of the track. 

c) Find the velocity of the ball at $t = 4.0\,\text{s}$.
