## PHYS 2110 Homework 27 - Torque

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
The 50 kg beams in the figures below are held in equilibrium by tension in cables angles upwards at 30$^\circ$ to the beam. The cable is attached to the end of the beam in (a) and to the middle of the beam in (b). Find the tensions in each case.

### Question 2: 
A box of 5.6 kg sits 3 meters from the right-hand side of a 10 meter long beam of 20 kg. The beam is supported on the left by a rope that is exactly 0.5 meters from the left end of the beam. The other side is supported by resting on Alex's head.

a) Draw an extended free-body diagram for the beam.  
b) Determine the magnitude of the normal force from Alex's head on the beam.  
c) Find the tension in the rope.  
d) The rope will break is more than 150 N of force is applied to it. If we slide the box to the left, the tension in the rope increases. How far can we slide the box (from its starting position) before the rope breaks?
