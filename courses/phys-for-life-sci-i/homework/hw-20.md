## PHYS 2110 Homework 20 - Systems

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A skier of mass $m = 80$ kg starts from rest at point A and skis down a hill and then up a smaller hill having a radius of curvature $R = 25$ m. The skier is testing a new pair of frictionless skies.

a) Find the work (if any) done by the snow on the skier with frictionless skies as they move from point A to point C. Explain you reasoning.  
b) Find the kinetic energy of the skier at point B.  
c)  Find the seed of the skier at point C.  
d) Find the acceleration of the skier (magnitude and direction) at point C.  
e) Find the magnitude of the normal force acting on the skier at point C.

### Question 2: 
A 3 kg block is launched tom rest at point A by a spring of spring constant $k = 64$ N/m onto a frictionless track, though there is a 1.5 m long section with friction ($\mu_k = 0.30$) immediately after point B. The block slides along the track, up over a hill (point C), and then collides with another spring at point D, causing the block to turn around and go the other way.

a) The block is found to be traveling at a speed of 4 m/s when it gets to point C (at the top of the hill). If the spring is initially compressed by an amount $\Delta s = 0.5$ m, find the height $h$ of the block at point A.   
b) Find the normal force (magnitude and direction) exerted by the track onto the bock at point C.   
c) The spring at point D has a spring constant of 42 N/m. How far will the spring be compressed wen the block comes to a momentary stop?
