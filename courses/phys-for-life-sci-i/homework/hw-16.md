## PHYS 2110 Homework 16 - 

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A new toy has been invented that consists of two identical balls connected by two massless strings. The balls are swung at a constant speed in a vertical circle. String 1 connects ball A to the center of the circle and String 2 connect ball B to ball A. Consider the instant the balls are at the lowest point in their swing, vertically aligned with one another.

a) Draw a free-body diagram and indicate the direction of the acceleration of ball A. If the acceleration is zero, please state so explicitly.

b) Is the tension in String 2 greater than, equal to, or less than the tension in String 1? Use you free-body diagram and one of Newton’s laws to explain your reasoning.

c) If the mass of each ball is 1.5 kg, and ball B is moving at 3 m/s at the instant shown on a circular path of radius 1 meter, find the tension in String 2.

  alt="Two identical balls labeled A and B are shown aligned vertically. Ball A is above ball B, and they are connected by a string labeled String 2. The upper string connecting ball A to the center of its circular path is labeled String 1. The lower string, labeled “String 2,” connects ball A to ball B. The figure depicts both balls at the bottom of a circular path."

### Question 2: 
A 10 kg block rests on a table for which the coefficient of static friction between the block and the tabletop is exactly 0.4. The block is connected to a massless knot by a horizontal string. Another block of mass m hangs from the knot, and another string goes up at an angle of 30-degrees to a wall, as shown to the right. There are three (3) strings in total for this problem, all of which connect to each other at the knot.

Find the largest possible mass m can be such that the the 10 kg block does not begin to slide.

> Hint: Draw a free body diagram of both blocks and the massless knot.

  alt="A tabletop supports a rectangular block labeled 10 kg. A knot to the right of the block connects three strings: one runs horizontally from the block to the knot, one runs upward and to the right at a 30 degree angle above the horizontal toward a wall, and one hangs vertically downward with a smaller hanging block labeled m. All three strings meet at the knot."
