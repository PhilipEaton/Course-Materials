## PHYS 2110 Homework 02 - Displacement and Velocity

---

-  Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from \textit{College Physics: Putting It All Together} by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
Christina is an avid cross-country skier. On the first day of her trip she travels 25 km in a direction 37-degrees south of east and set camp for the night. The following day she travels another 25 km in a direction 53-degrees south of west and sets camp. In the final day of her trip she skis 30 km due north.  (Below you will find the first leg of this trip already drawn. Check that the direction is correct before drawing in the next segment of the trip.)


What is her total displacement (magnitude and direction) for the 3-day trip? Below is a sketch of the first leg of her trip. It may be helpful to finish drawing the full trip and them finding the horizontal and vertical components of each leg of the trip.

### Question 2: 
Two cars are traveling from point A to point C, as shown in the figure below. Each car moves with constant velocity throughout the entire trip. Point B is 25 km from point A, and point C is 40 km beyond point B, as shown.

  alt="A straight horizontal path showing three labeled points: A, B, and C. The distance from A to B is marked as 25 kilometers, and from B to C as 40 kilometers. Two cars travel from A to C along this line, each with constant velocity."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; max-width:600px; width:70%;">

Car 1 leave point A at 12:00 pm (noon) and reaches point B at 12:20 pm (the same day). Car 2 leaves point A at 12:10 pm, just after Car 1, and arrives at point B at 12:27 pm. Which car will arrive at point C first? Explain your reasoning.
