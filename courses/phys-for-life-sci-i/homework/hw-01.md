## PHYS 2110 Homework 01 - Vectors and Displacement

---

-  Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from \textit{College Physics: Putting It All Together} by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
For each of the right-triangles given below, the magnitude of the hypotenuse and one of the angles is given. Find the lengths of the other two sides. Don't forget your units!

### Question 2: 
Scout master Greg and his scout troupe are working on their orienteering merit badge and are going on a couple of hikes. Your job is to fond the magnitude and direction for their total displacement for each of their trips. 

a) Hike 1: They start at an old stump in the center of a large open meadow. They first march 600 meters north. Then they march 250 meters south. Finally, they march 450 meters north, again.

b) After returning to the original stump, they begin Hike 2: They first march 800 meters west. Then they march 600 meters north.
