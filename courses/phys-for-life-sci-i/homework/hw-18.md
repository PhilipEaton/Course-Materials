## PHYS 2110 Homework 18 - 

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A force $f = 60\ \text{N}$ acts on a block at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the horizontal floor, up and to the left. Find the work done on the block by the force as the block moves through a displacement of 2 meters to the right.

### Question 2: 
A car moving at 20 km/hr skids 10 m with locked brakes before coming to rest. 

How far will the car skid on the same surface if it were going 80 km/hr initially?

> Hint: You approach this problem in one of two ways.  
> 1) You can use the given information to find the kinetic friction between the car and the road, then use that to help answer the question.
> 2) You can use some proportional reasoning to get the factor by which the skid displacement will need to be given the increase in speed.
