## PHYS 2110 Homework 07 - 2D Acceleration

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A penguin starts from rest and accelerates across the snow at a constant rate until it hits the ice, as depicted below. The penguin then throws itself down and begins to slide along on frictionless ice. It then goes over the edge into an ice gully and slides up a vertical ice cliff on the other side.

  alt="A continuous path showing a penguin’s motion across three regions. The penguin begins on a flat, snowy surface where it accelerates from rest, then transitions onto smooth, frictionless ice where it slides horizontally, and finally moves over an edge into a curved ice gully that slopes downward and then upward into a vertical ice cliff on the opposite side. Several labeled points are marked along the path to indicate where students should draw velocity and acceleration vectors."

a) Along the path the penguin takes in the figure above, draw an arrow to represent the penguin’s velocity at each of the labeled points, including roughly scaling the lengths of the velocity to represent the penguin’s speed at each point. If the penguin’s speed is zero at any point, then write “$v =0\ \text{m/s}$” by the point.

b) Draw arrows to represent the direction of the penguin’s acceleration at each of the labeled points. If the acceleration is zero at any of the points, then write “$0\ \frac{\text{m/s}}{\text{s}}$” by the point.

### Question 2: 
A student observes the motion of a skitter bug gliding on the surface of a pond and carefully sketches the bug’s trajectory, as shown below. At several labeled points (A–F), the student has drawn arrows representing the directions of the bug’s velocity and acceleration vectors. The student also knows the bug started *from rest at point A*.

The sizes of the arrows are not meaningful. This means you cannot determine whether the bug is speeding up or slowing down from arrow length. You can only use:
- the direction of the velocity arrows,
- the direction of the acceleration arrows, and
- the shape of the path (whether it is straight or curving).

  alt="A trajectory of a skitter bug gliding across the surface of a pond, curving and changing direction several times. The path includes labeled points A through F. At each point, arrows show the directions of the velocity and acceleration vectors as drawn by a student. The figure is used to analyze whether the indicated directions of velocity and acceleration are correct at each location."
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; max-width:600px; width:90%;">

a) For points A–E only, decide whether the direction of the velocity arrow and the direction of the acceleration arrow are correct. If either one is incorrect, state what the correct direction should be and briefly explain your reasoning.

Use the table below.

| Point | Velocity direction correct?  | If not, explain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Acceleration direction correct? | If not, explain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
|:----:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| A |  |  |  |  |  
| B |  |  |  |  |  
| C |  |  |  |  |  
| D |  |  |  |  |  
| E |  |  |  |  |  



b) Assume the student has drawn the correct directions of the velocity and acceleration vectors at point F.

Is the bug’s speed increasing, decreasing, or neither at point F? Explain your reasoning clearly using the relationship between the directions of velocity and acceleration.
