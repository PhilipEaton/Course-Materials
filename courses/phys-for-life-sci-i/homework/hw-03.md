## PHYS 2110 Homework 03 - Velocity II

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
Consider the following figure of a ball pictured at various times while rolling some ramps. The time of each instance is shown above the ball. Assume the \textit{middle segment of the track} is made from a 2 meters long wooden cutout and that the ball started from rest at 0.3 seconds. Note: The drawing it \textit{not} to scale and you do not know the length of any of the segments other than the middle one!

a) Find the velocity of the ball at 2.3 seconds.  
b) Find the acceleration of the ball while it was traveling down the first ramp.  
c) Using your results from parts (a) and (b), find the velocity of the ball at 3.1 seconds.

  alt="A schematic drawing of a ball rolling along a track made of three connected segments. The first and third segments are angled downward at the same angle theta relative to the horizontal. The middle segment is flat; labeled as 2 meters long. The ball’s position is shown at four different times: t equals 0.3 s at the top of the first ramp; t equals 2.3 s at the beginning of the flat segment; t equals 2.7 s near the end of the flat segment; and t equals 3.1 s at the bottom of the last ramp."
