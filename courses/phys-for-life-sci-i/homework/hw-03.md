## PHYS 2110 Homework 03 - Velocity II

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
The positions of objects A and B are graphed to the right. Answer the following questions and explain. 
	
a) Is the acceleration of object A positive, negative, or zero at $t = 2\,\text{s}$? 

b) At $t = 2\,\text{s}$, is object B speeding up, slowing down, or moving with constant speed?

c) Is the acceleration of object B positive, negative, or zero at $t = 2\,\text{s}$? 

d) Do the two objects ever have the same position? If so, at what time?

e) Which object has the greater speed at $t=11\,\text{s}$

f) Find the average velocity of object B for the 20-second interval shown.

g) Is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of object B at $t = 14 \,\text{s}$, larger than, smaller than, or the same its average velocity for the 20-second interval shown?

The middle segment is flat; labeled as 2 meters long. The ball’s position is shown at four different times: t equals 0.3 s at the top of the first ramp; t equals 2.3 s at the beginning of the flat segment; t equals 2.7 s near the end of the flat segment; and t equals 3.1 s at the bottom of the last ramp."
