## PHYS 2110 Homework 26 - Stability

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A block hangs from a massless string that is wound around a solid circular pulley of radius 20 cm. There is no friction in the pulley. The block is released from rest, and the pulley goes through three complete rotations ($6\pi$ radians) in 4 seconds.

a) What is the angular acceleration of the pulley (magnitude and direction)?  
b) How far does the block drop in this time? 

At the end of the 4 seconds, a hand reaches out and touches the pulley, producing a constant frictional force what slows the block's descent.

c) What is the direction of the pulley's angular velocity? Explain your answer.   
d) What is the direction of the pulley's angular acceleration? Explain your answer.    
e) Is the magnitude of the torque by the hand on the pulley less than, equal to or greater than the magnitude of the torque by the string on the pulley? Explain.

### Question 2: 
In a 2-dimensional coordinate system, a 4 kg ball is placed at the origin and a 6 kg ball is placed on the x-axis at $x = 2$ m. A third ball of mass 10 kg is placed at $x = 0.8$ m, $y = 1$ m. Find the location of the center of mass of the system. (Remember, the center of mass is a vector, so direction matters!)
