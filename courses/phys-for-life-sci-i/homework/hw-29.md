## PHYS 2110 Homework 29 - Pressure-Density

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
How deep must you dive in a lake of alcohol ($\rho = 790\,\text{kg/m}^3$) to increase the pressure by 3 atmospheres? (Use $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$ to get the technically correct value.)

### Question 2: 
At sea level even a ``perfect'' vacuum at the top of a pipe can only suck water up the pipe to a height of 10 m. At an elevation of 4800 ft will a complete vacuum raise the water to more than 10 m, exactly 10 m, or less than 10 m? Explain you reasoning.
