## PHYS 2110 Homework 12 - Static Friction

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A person pushes horizontally on a 100 kg crate, as shown in the two figures below. The coefficient of kinetic between the crate and the floor is 0.2; the coefficient of static friction is 0.4.

a) For each of the two situation described in the figures, indicate whether the frictional force is kinetic or static.

b) In each case, find the magnitude of the frictional force.

### Question 2: 
Alex pulls in the leftward direction on a string attached to a wooden block with a mass of 80 kg. The tension in the string is 300 N and the string makes an angle of 37-degrees with respect to the horizontal. The floor is very rough (kinetic coefficient of friction of 0.35 and static coefficient of friction of 0.75) and the block does not move.

a) Draw a free-body diagram for the block.

b) Find the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the floor on the block.

c) Find the magnitude of the frictional force exerted by the floor on the block.
