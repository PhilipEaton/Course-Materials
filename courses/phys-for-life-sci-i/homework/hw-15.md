## PHYS 2110 Homework 15 - Circular Motion (Centripetal Acceleration)

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
A cylindrical room is rotating fast enough that two small blocks stacked against the wall do not drop. The mass of block A is 4 kg and that of block B is 3 kg.

a) Draw a free-body diagram for each of the blocks. Due sure to indicate the direction of the acceleration at the instant shown in the figure to the right. If the acceleration is zero, please state that explicitly.

b) Identify any third-law paired forces within your diagrams.

c) Rank the magnitude of all the horizontal forces within your FBDs from largest to smallest.

d) Determine the magnitude of the vertical forces on block A. If this it not possible to determine some of these forces, explain why not.

### Question 2: 
To test the ability of a sports car to turn a corner at high speed, the car is driven around a flat circular pavement track called a skidpad. The car is driven at higher and higher speeds, until is starts to slip on the pavement. At this point the speed is noted and the centripetal acceleration calculated. On a certain skidpad of radius 31.4 m, a GTI’s top speed around the circle was found to be 17.0 m/s.

a) What was the centripetal acceleration of the GTI? What fraction is this of the gravitational acceleration?

b) What is the static friction coefficient between the pavement and the tires of the GTI?
