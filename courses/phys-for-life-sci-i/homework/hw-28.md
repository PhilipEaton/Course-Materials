## PHYS 2110 Homework 28 - Conservation of Angular Momentum

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
Alex and Philip, having decided on new professions, have begun work at a lumber mill where they hold heavy uniform beams in lave on frictionless rolls (presumably to be cut). The board is 2 m long and has a mass of 90 kg. It is perched on a frictionless roller 50 cm from the right end of the beam. Alex, who is on the right end of the beam, thinks he is helping by applying a horizontal force to the left of 400 N. Philip, who is on the left most end, applies te needed force to keep the board in equilibrium. 

a) Draw an extended free-body diagram of the beam. Add an arrow indicated the direction Philip must push on the beam to keep it in equilibrium.   
b) Find the magnitude of the force Philip must exert to keep the board from moving. Hint: You may have to use a combination of force and torque techniques here.

### Question 2: 
 A spacecraft orbits the earth in an elliptical orbit, going from an apogee (the furthest point between the planet and the satellite) of 21,000 km from the center of the earth to a perigee (the closes point between the planet and the satellite) of 7,000 km from the center of the earth. When the satellite is at apogee it has an orbital speed of 3 km/s.

  alt="Perigee is the point of closest orbit to the object, in this case the Earth. You are told this is 7000 km and you have an unknown velcoity directed perpendicular to the line connecting the Earth and the spacecraft. Apogee is the farthest the spacecraft gets from earth in its orbit. This is given as 21000 km with a velocity of 3 km/s directed perpendicual ro the line connecting Earth and the spacecraft."

a) Explain how we know that the angular momentum of the earth-spacecraft system is conserved.  
b) What will be the orbital speed of the spacecraft at perigee?
