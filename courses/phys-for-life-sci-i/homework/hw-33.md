## PHYS 2110 Homework 33 - Ideal Gas Law

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should contain a conceptual justification for any physical laws/equations used to solve the problem.
- Please offer a one sentence explanation for any mathematical steps that are more than just algebra.
- Most problems are taken from *College Physics: Putting It All Together* by Hellings, Adams, and Francis

### Question 1: 
Specific heat of ice is 2.1 J/(g K). Specific heat of copper is 0.4 J/(g K). Latent heat of fusion for water is 334 J/g. A 400 g piece of copper is heated up to 500$^\circ C$ and placed on top of a 400 g block of ice at -20$^\circ C$.


a) How much of the ice will melt?  
b) To what temperature would the copper piece need to be heated up to in order to melt the block of ice completely?

### Question 2: 
 A scuba diver releases air bubbles from his breathing apparatus at a depth of 96 m where the was pressure is $1 \times 10^7$  N/m$^2$. Each bubble coming out of the apparatus contains 0.001 mole of air and the water temperature is 290 K.


a)  What is the volume of the air bubbles when they first form?  
b) If the water pressure at 70 m is $0.8 \times 10^7$  N/m$^2$, what would be the volume of the air bubbles by the time they rise to 70 m depth?
