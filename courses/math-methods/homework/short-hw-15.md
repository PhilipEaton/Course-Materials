## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 15

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.

Consider the second-order differential equation:

$$
y'' - 2y' + y = e^x + x^2
$$

##### Part 1: Homogeneous Solution and Reduction of Order

a) Solve the associated homogeneous equation:

$$
y'' - 2y' + y = 0
$$

and verify that $ y_1(x) = e^x $ is a solution.

b) Using reduction of order, find a second, linearly independent solution $ y_2(x) $.


#####  Part 2: Wronskian and Linear Independence

c) Compute the Wronskian of the solutions $ y_1(x) $ and $ y_2(x) $. Verify that the solutions are linearly independent.


#####  Part 3: Finding a Particular Solution

d)  Use the method of undetermined coefficients to find a particular solution $ y_p(x) $ for the inhomogeneous equation:

$$
y'' - 2y' + y = e^x + x^2
$$

Hint: Solve for the particular solution in two parts:
- Solve $ y'' - 2y' + y = e^x $  
- Solve $ y'' - 2y' + y = x^2 $  
- The final solution is the sum of the two.  

	
e) Write the general solution $ y(x) $ to the given ODE by combining the homogeneous and particular solutions.


##### Bonus Challenge
Bonus) If the initial conditions are $ y(0) = 3 $ and $ y'(0) = -2 $, determine the values of the constants in the general solution.
