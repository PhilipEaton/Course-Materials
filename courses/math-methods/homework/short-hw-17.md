## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 17

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.


### Problem 1: Solving an Initial Value Problem
Solve the following initial value problem using Laplace Transforms:

$$
y'' + 4y' + 5y = 0, \quad y(0) = 2, \quad y'(0) = -1.
$$

Express your final answer in terms of exponentials and sines/cosines.

### Problem 2: Forced Oscillations and Laplace Transforms
A damped oscillator is governed by:

$$
m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F_0 e^{-t}, \quad x(0) = 0, \quad x'(0) = 0.
$$

Using Laplace Transforms, solve for $ x(t) $. Assume $ m = 1 $, $ b = 2 $, and $ k = 5 $.
