## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 18

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.

### Problem 1: Solving an Electrical Circuit Problem
Consider an RC circuit with a step input:

$$
R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{q}{C} = V_0 U(t).
$$

Given $ R = 2 $ ohms, $ C = 1 $ farad, and $ V_0 = 5 $ volts, solve for the charge $ q(t) $ using Laplace Transforms.

### Problem 2: Modeling an Impulse Response
A mass-spring system satisfies:

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega_0^2 x = J \delta(t),
$$

where $ J $ is the impulse applied at $ t = 0 $. Solve for $ x(t) $ using Laplace Transforms and interpret your result.
