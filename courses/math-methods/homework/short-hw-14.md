## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 14

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.

Consider a mass-spring-damper system governed by the differential equation:

$$
m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0
$$

where $ m $ is the mass, $ b $ is the damping coefficient, and $ k $ is the spring constant. For this problem, assume:

$$
m = 1\ \text{kg}, \quad b = 2 \, \text{N}\cdot\text{s/m}, \quad k = 5\ \text{N/m}.
$$

a) Write the differential equation for this system using the given parameters.
	
b) Derive the characteristic equation associated with this ODE and solve for its roots.
	
c) Based on the roots, classify the system as underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped. Explain your reasoning.
	
d) Find the general solution $ x(t) $ for the system.
	
e) Discuss the physical interpretation of your solution. In particular:
	
- How do the damping and stiffness affect the behavior of the system?  
- What is the significance of the transient response in this context?  
- How would the long-term behavior (steady state) of the system appear?
