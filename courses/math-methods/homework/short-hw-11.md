## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 11

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.



A water tank initially contains $ V_0 $ liters of water. Water is pumped into the tank at a \textbf{constant rate} $ R_{\text{in}} = \text{a constant} $. Simultaneously, water leaks out of the tank at a rate proportional to the square root of the current water volume, given by:

$$
R_{\text{out}} = k \sqrt{V(t)}
$$

where $ k $ is a positive constant and $ V(t) $ is the volume of water in the tank at time $ t $.


a) Write down the differential equation that governs the change in volume $ V(t) $ in the tank.
	
> Hint: The rate of change of the volume ($\frac{dV}{dt}$) should have something to do with the rate of water being pored in and the rate of water leaving. This is \textit{very} similar to the height of water in a bucket example we looked at previously.

	
b) Determine the steady-state volume $ V_{\text{Steady}} $ by setting the time derivative $ \frac{dV}{dt} $ to zero.
	
c) Rewrite the differential equation in separable form and solve it to obtain the general solution for $ V(t) $.
	
d) Given $ V(0) = V_0 $, find the particular solution for $ V(t) $.
	
e) Explain the behavior of $ V(t) $ as $ t \to \infty $. What does the solution imply about the water volume in the tank over time? Does this agree with the steady-state solution you found?
