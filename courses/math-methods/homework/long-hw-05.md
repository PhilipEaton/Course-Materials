## PHYS 3345 - Long Homework 05

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.

### 1) Classifying and Solving via the Characteristic Equation

For each of the following second-order linear ODEs, do the following:
- Write down the characteristic equation.
- Solve for the general solution.
- Classify the solution as overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped (when appropriate).

$$
\text{a)} \quad y'' + 4y' + 4y = 0 \qquad
\text{b)} \quad y'' + 6y' + 10y = 0 \qquad
\text{c)} \quad y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0
$$

### 2) Reduction of Order

Given that $ y_1(x) = e^x $ is a solution to the differential equation:

$$
y'' - 2y' + y = 0
$$

use the method of reduction of order to find a second, linearly independent solution $ y_2(x) $, and write down the general solution to the ODE.

### 3) Wronskian and Linear Independence

Consider the functions:

$$
y_1(x) = x \quad \text{and} \quad y_2(x) = x\ln x
$$

a) Compute the Wronskian $ W\{y_1, y_2\}(x) $.
b) Based on your result, are $ y_1 $ and $ y_2 $ linearly independent on $ x > 0 $?
c) Suppose both functions are solutions to some second-order ODE. What does the Wronskian tell you about the general solution?



### 4) Undetermined Coefficients – Polynomial and Exponential Forcing

Use the method of undetermined coefficients to find a particular solution, and then the general solution, to each of the following:

$$
\text{a)} \quad y'' - y = x \qquad\qquad
\text{b)} \quad y'' + 2y' + y = e^{-x} \qquad\qquad
\text{c)} \quad y'' - 4y = e^{2x}
$$

### 5) Undetermined Coefficients – Trig Forcing

Use undetermined coefficients to solve:

$$
y'' + 4y = \cos(2x)
$$

> Hint: Check the homogeneous solution before you make your guess.
