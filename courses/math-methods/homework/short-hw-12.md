## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 12

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.



A fish population in a lake grows exponentially with a per capita growth rate $ r $ but is subject to a constant harvest of $ H $ fish per unit time. The dynamics of the population $ P(t) $ are modeled by the differential equation

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = rP - H
$$

with the initial condition

$$
P(0) = P_0
$$


a) Write the differential equation in the standard linear form.  
b) Determine the integrating factor and use it to solve for the general solution $ P(t) $.  
c) Find the equilibrium population $ P_{\text{eq}} $ by setting $\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$.  
d) Discuss the long-term behavior of $ P(t) $ in terms of $ r $ and $ H $. In particular, explain what happens as $ t \to \infty $ and how changes in the harvest rate $ H $ affect the equilibrium population.



> Hint: Recall that for a first-order linear ODE in standard form

	$$
	\frac{dP}{dt} + \left(-r\right)P(t) = -H
	$$
    
	Find the integrating factor and use it to transform the equation into one that can be integrated directly.  
	Do not forget to apply your initial conditions!
