Consider a three-dimensional stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, which describes the state of stress at a point in a material under loading conditions. The stress tensor is defined as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
	4 & 2 & 0 \\
	2 & 5 & 1 \\
	0 & 1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The stress tensor (a fancy way of saying matrix in most situations) tells us about how the materials is compressed/stretched or is being twisted. 

a) Calculate the Determinant of $\mathbf{\sigma}$. (The determinant of the stress tensor provides insight into the state of stress in the material and can be used to assess stability.). 

b) Calculate the Trace of $\mathbf{\sigma}$. (The trace of the stress tensor represents the sum of the normal stresses acting on the material, which can influence material behavior under load.)  

c) Calculate the Transpose of $\mathbf{\sigma}$. (The transpose of the stress tensor helps verify its properties, particularly since the stress tensor must be symmetric for physical applications. Is the given stress tensor symmetric? How do you know?)  

d) Calculate the Inverse of $\mathbf{\sigma}$. (The inverse of the stress tensor can be useful for transformations in continuum mechanics, especially in determining the relationship between stress and strain.)
