## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 04

---

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.

Consider an electric dipole with dipole moment $ \vec{p} $ (this could be a molecule like H$_2$O or something that inherently has an electric dipole) placed in a uniform electric field $ \vec{E} $. 

The torque $ \vec{\tau} $ exerted on the dipole is given by the cross product of the electric dipole moment and the electric field:

$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
$$

Additionally, the potential energy $ U $ of the electric dipole in an electric field is given by:

$$
U = - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
$$

Suppose an external force applies an angular displacement vector $ \vec{\alpha} $, which represents the angle (in radians) through which the dipole rotates in the plane of the electric field.

Given the following vectors:

- $ \vec{p} = 4 \hat{i} - 2 \hat{j} + 3 \hat{k} \, \text{Cm} $ (electric dipole moment),
- $ \vec{E} = 2 \hat{i} + \hat{j} - 3 \hat{k} \, \text{N/C} $ (electric field),
- $ \vec{\alpha} = -\hat{i} + 2 \hat{j} + \hat{k} $ (rotation vector in radians)


Find the following: 

a) The torque $ \vec{\tau} $ exerted on the electric dipole.  

b) The potential energy $ U $ of the electric dipole in the electric field.  

c)  The work $ W $ done by the electric field on the dipole as it rotates through the angle $ \vec{\alpha} $.
