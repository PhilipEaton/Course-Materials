## PHYS 3345 - Short Homework 13

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.



Consider the differential equation

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{3}{x}\,y = x^2\, y^2
$$

which might arise in a simplified chemical reaction model.

a) **Bernoulli's Equation**
Show that this ODE is of Bernoulli type with $ n = 2 $. Use the substitution

$$
v = y^{\,1-n} = y^{-1}
$$

and express the ODE in terms of $ v(x) $. Solve the resulting linear ODE to find the general solution for $ y(x) $.
	
b) **Particular Solution**
Given the initial condition

$$
y(1) = 1
$$

find the particular solution.
	
c) **Qualitative Analysis**
Perform a qualitative analysis by:
- Identifying the equilibrium lines and sketching them in a plot.
- Discussing the stability of the equilibrium lines you found.

Hint: Recall that a Bernoulli equation of the form 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)y^n
$$

can be linearized by the substitution $ v = y^{1-n} $, after which standard techniques (such as the integrating factor method) can be used to solve for $ v(x) $ and then recover $ y(x) $.
