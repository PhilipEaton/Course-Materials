Consider the second-order differential equation:

$$
y'' - 4y' + 4y = \frac{e^{2x}}{x}
$$

where $ x > 0 $. 

a) Find the general solution of the associated homogeneous ODE:

$$
y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0
$$

a) Using the homogeneous solutions $ y_1(x) $ and $ y_2(x) $, express the particular solution $ y_p(x) $ in the form:

$$
y_p(x) = u_1(x)y_1(x) + u_2(x)y_2(x)
$$

Derive the system of equations for $ u_1'(x) $ and $ u_2'(x) $ using the variation of parameters method.

a) Evaluate the Wronskian $ W(y_1, y_2) $.

a) Find explicit expressions for $ u_1(x) $ and $ u_2(x) $ by computing the necessary integrals.

a) Combine the homogeneous and particular solutions to express the full general solution.
