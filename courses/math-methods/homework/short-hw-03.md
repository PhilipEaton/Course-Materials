## Problem:

- Please keep your work organized and neat.
- Solutions should follow a logical progression and should not skip major conceptual/mathematical steps.
- Provide brief explanations for non-trivial mathematical steps beyond simple algebra.


A charged particle is moving in the $xy$-plane with an initial velocity directed at a 30$^\circ$ angle from the $x$-axis. We can represent this velocity as a column matrix in the following manner:

$$
\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v \cos 30^\circ \\ v \sin 30^\circ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} v \\ \frac{1}{2} v \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity.

Let's suppose the charged particle:

1) First encounters a magnetic field that rotates the velocity by 45$^\circ$ counterclockwise.  
2) Then, it collides with a perfectly reflecting surface oriented along the line $y = -x$.


**Questions:**

a) Calculate the rotated velocity vector after the particle passes through the magnetic field.  
	
b) Apply the reflection matrix for the $ y = -x $ surface to find the velocity of the particle after the collision.  


> Hint: Carefully consider how a surface oriented along $ y = -x $ will affect the direction of a particle
>  reflecting off it, and how this can be represented with a matrix. You do not need to perform the same 
> transformations as above unless you wish to; you can derive the reflection matrix conceptually.
