# PHYS 3345 – Mathematical Methods for Engineers and Scientists

These notes support PHYS 3345, a course on the mathematical techniques used throughout upper-division physics.

The materials below are organized into the following groups: lecture notes, homework sets, and practice days & 
solutions. Solutions for homework sets can be found in the course Blackboard.

## Lecture Notes
- [Lectures](lectures/)
- Lecture notes are intended to be read **before or after class**

## Assignments
- [Homework Sets](homework/)
- Short homework sets are short and meant to reinforce both conceptual and computational skills directly related to the relevant lecture.
- Long homework sets (bi-weekly homework) similarly reinforce both conceptual and computational skills, but at a deeper level with more difficult problems. 


## Practice Days
- [Practice Days](practice/)
- Practice days are designed for **in-class group work**. See the course schedule in Blackboard for details.

## Accessibility Note

All mathematical expressions are rendered using MathML-backed LaTeX
for accessibility and screen-reader compatibility. If you have any 
issues, please reach out so they can be corrected.
